            <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
            <p> I am a Computer Science Engineering student at SRM Ramapuram, Chennai, with a strong aesthetic sense designing creative and functional interfaces.<br>
                 My primary interests lie in web development, and I have a deep passion for learning about AI. As a UI\UX developer, I focus on creating user-centric designs that are both visually appealing and highly functional.
                <br>
                I have participated in hackathons to gain practical experience and explore various pathways in technology. I am constantly driven to learn new things, and I have completed multiple courses to keep my skills up-to-date and relevant.<br> My academic performance,is that I have secured 8.62 CGPA up to my second year.<br>
                <br>
                I am eager to fully immerse myself in web development. In addition to my technical pursuits, I enjoy mentoring others, engaging in creative writing, and journaling, which help me stay inspired and balanced.
